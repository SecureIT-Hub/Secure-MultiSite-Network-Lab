# Secure Multi-Site Network Lab – Topology & Configs

As part of my journey toward CCNP Security and Fortinet FCP, I built a secure virtual lab environment using Cisco IOS, FortiGate, and Linux servers.

This repository includes:
- A full EVE-NG topology
- Site-to-site IPsec VPN (Cisco ↔ Fortinet)
- Linux-based DNS and Web servers
- NAT, DMZ, and ACL segmentation
- CLI-based troubleshooting commands and logs

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Cisco IOS (R1, R2)
- FortiGate 7.x
- Ubuntu Server (DNS, Web)
- EVE-NG for simulation
- Static & dynamic routing
- IPsec Phase 1/2 VPN
- NAT / PAT and Firewall Rules

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `topology/` → Network diagrams in .drawio and .png formats  
- `configs/` → All config files: Cisco IOS, FortiGate, Linux servers  
- `eve-ng/` → EVE-NG `.unl` file and notes  

## 🛠 Requirements

- EVE-NG installed (bare metal or VM)
- FortiGate image (7.x) added to EVE
- Cisco IOS images (e.g., vIOS)
- Basic Linux knowledge
